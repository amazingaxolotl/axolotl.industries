      <p>Writing software is hard. Visualizing its behavior makes it easier.</p>

      <p>
        Our current toolbox has unit tests, REPLs, static analysis, walkthrough
        debuggers, hot code reloading, visual programming, data flow diagrams,
        and more.
      </p>

      <p>But we can do more. Much more.</p>

      <p>
        As introduced in my previous post, I’m working on Tastes. It’s a
        Typescript library for intelligent sampling for use in software
        visualization. The idea is to show the extent of states in which a piece
        of code can exhibit with minimal setup from the coder.
      </p>

      <p>Thinking about this has raised some interesting questions!</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If we can’t show every state, which ones do we pick?</li>
        <li>And how do we visualize the ones we do select?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Welcome to the world of hyper-dimensional spelunking. Grab your
        third-dimensional helmet and fifteen-dimensional rope.
      </p>

      <p>We’re going in!</p>
